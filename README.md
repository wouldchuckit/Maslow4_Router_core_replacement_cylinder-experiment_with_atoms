# Maslow4_Router_core_replacement_cylinder

![](/project.svg)



 Attempt to make a cylinder to replace the router using wood or plastic and the maslow4. You can change the thickness of the wood stock. If you change it you would need to make a different number of simple circular slices. I used 7 slices with .5 inch thick wood stock. Hardware for this is 4 1/8 in threaded rods and corresponding washers and nuts It will still require something to hold the computer board.
